## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture
The app follows a three-layer architecture:
1. **Presentation Layer**: Jetpack Compose UI components and ViewModels
2. **Domain Layer**: Use cases and business logic
3. **Data Layer**: Repositories, Room database, and Firebase integration

### Data Models
- `TarotCard`: Represents individual Tarot cards with meanings, descriptions, and associations
- `TarotDeck`: Represents Tarot decks with metadata
- `TarotSpread`: Represents reading layouts with positions
- `SpreadPosition`: Represents individual positions within spreads
- `Reading`: Represents completed readings with interpretations
- `CardDrawing`: Represents cards drawn in specific positions

### Database
- Room database implementation with entities for all data models
- DAO (Data Access Object) with CRUD operations for all entities
- Database initializer with sample data for Major and Minor Arcana cards
- Type converters for handling Date objects in the database

### AI Components
- `TarotCardDetector`: TensorFlow Lite model for card identification
- `SpreadLayoutRecognizer`: TensorFlow Lite model for spread layout identification
- `AIReadingEigenvalueCalculator`: Algorithm for calculating reading eigenvalues based on AI confidence

### Navigation
- Jetpack Compose Navigation implementation
- Screen routing for all app features
- Passing of parameters between screens

## UI/UX Implementation

### Screens
- Home screen with feature navigation
- Deck selection screen
- Spread selection screen
- Card selection screen with shuffling animation
- Reading result screen with interpretation display
- Reading history screen with filtering options
- Tarot dictionary screen with card browsing
- Card detail screen with comprehensive information
- Learning modules screen with educational content
- Custom spread creator screen with canvas interface
- Camera screen for AI-powered spread analysis

### Design Elements
- Material 3 theme implementation
- Responsive layouts for different screen sizes
- Interactive components with visual feedback
- Card-based design for content display
- Consistent navigation patterns

### Animations
- Card shuffling animation with rotation effect
- Smooth transitions between screens
- Animated card appearance in reading results
- Visual feedback for user interactions

### Accessibility
- High contrast mode support
- Large text mode support
- Semantic content descriptions
- Accessible color schemes
