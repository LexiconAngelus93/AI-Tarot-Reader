# Tarot Reading Android App - Architecture Design

## 1. Architecture Overview

The app will follow the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern with Clean Architecture principles to ensure separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability.

### Layers:

1. **Presentation Layer**
   - Activities/Fragments (Views)
   - ViewModels
   - UI Components
   - Animations

2. **Domain Layer**
   - Use Cases
   - Domain Models
   - Repository Interfaces

3. **Data Layer**
   - Repositories Implementation
   - Data Sources (Local and Remote)
   - Data Models
   - API Services

## 2. Key Components

### Core Components:
- **TarotCardRecognizer**: ML-based component for card recognition from images
- **SpreadAnalyzer**: Analyzes card positions and generates interpretations
- **DeckManager**: Manages different Tarot decks and their properties
- **ReadingGenerator**: Creates and manages Tarot readings
- **UserHistoryManager**: Handles user reading history and notes

### Database Structure:
- **Decks**: Information about different Tarot decks
- **Cards**: Details of individual cards including images and meanings
- **Spreads**: Predefined and custom spread layouts
- **Readings**: User's reading history
- **Notes**: User notes attached to readings

### External Services:
- **ML Model Service**: For card recognition from images
- **Cloud Storage**: For storing user data and synchronization
- **Analytics Service**: For tracking app usage and performance

## 3. Technology Stack

### Core Technologies:
- **Language**: Kotlin
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose
- **Architecture Components**: ViewModel, LiveData, Room
- **Dependency Injection**: Hilt
- **Image Processing**: TensorFlow Lite, CameraX
- **Database**: Room (local), Firebase Firestore (cloud)
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **Storage**: Firebase Storage
- **Analytics**: Firebase Analytics

### Libraries:
- **Coroutines**: For asynchronous programming
- **Retrofit**: For API communication
- **Glide**: For image loading and caching
- **Material Components**: For UI design
- **Navigation Component**: For in-app navigation
- **ML Kit**: For image recognition
- **WorkManager**: For background tasks

## 4. Feature Modules

The app will be organized into the following feature modules:

1. **Core**: Base classes, utilities, and common components
2. **Authentication**: User authentication and profile management
3. **CardRecognition**: Image processing and card recognition
4. **DeckLibrary**: Tarot deck management and card dictionary
5. **ReadingExperience**: Digital reading functionality
6. **CustomSpreads**: Custom spread creation and management
7. **History**: Reading history and diary functionality
8. **Settings**: App settings and preferences

## 5. Data Flow

1. **Card Recognition Flow**:
   - User captures image → Image preprocessing → ML model analysis → Card identification → Spread analysis → Interpretation generation → Display to user

2. **Digital Reading Flow**:
   - User selects deck and spread → Card selection interface → User picks cards → Cards positioned in spread → Interpretation generation → Display to user

3. **Custom Spread Flow**:
   - User creates spread layout → Defines position meanings → Saves spread → Spread available for readings

4. **History Management Flow**:
   - Reading completed → Save to local database → Sync to cloud (if enabled) → Available in history view

## 6. Security Considerations

- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive user data
- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication
- **Privacy**: Clear privacy policy and data usage transparency
- **Permissions**: Minimal required permissions with clear explanations
- **Offline Security**: Secure local storage of readings and personal notes
