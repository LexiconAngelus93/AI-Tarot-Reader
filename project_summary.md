# Tarot Reading Android App - Project Summary

## Overview

The Tarot Reading Android App is a comprehensive, feature-rich application designed to provide users with an immersive and personalized Tarot reading experience. Combining cutting-edge technology with traditional Tarot practices, the app offers both beginners and experienced users a powerful tool for self-reflection, guidance, and spiritual exploration.

## Key Features

### 1. AI-Powered Physical Spread Analysis

One of the most innovative features of the app is its ability to analyze physical Tarot card spreads through image recognition:

- **Card Detection & Recognition**: Users can take a photo of physical Tarot cards laid out in a spread, and the app will automatically identify each card using advanced machine learning algorithms.
- **Spread Layout Recognition**: The app can recognize common spread patterns and match them to its database of spread layouts.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: After identifying the cards and spread, the app generates a detailed interpretation based on the specific cards, their positions, and their relationships.
- **Error Handling**: The system includes mechanisms to handle blurry images, incomplete spreads, or unidentified decks, guiding the user through corrective actions.

### 2. Guided Digital Tarot Reading

For users who prefer a fully digital experience, the app offers an interactive reading process:

- **Deck & Spread Selection**: Users can choose from a curated library of beautifully illustrated Tarot decks and predefined spread layouts.
- **Interactive Card Selection**: The app provides an engaging card selection interface with realistic shuffling animations and intuitive card drawing mechanics.
- **Dynamic Spread Visualization**: Selected cards are displayed in their respective positions within the chosen spread layout with smooth animations.
- **Detailed Interpretation**: Each reading includes individual card meanings, position-specific interpretations, and a holistic analysis of the entire spread.
- **Eigenvalue Calculation**: A unique feature that calculates the numerical "eigenvalue" of the reading, providing additional insight through Major Arcana correspondence.

### 3. Custom Spread Creation

The app empowers users to design their own unique Tarot spreads:

- **Intuitive Design Canvas**: A drag-and-drop interface allows users to create custom spread layouts with precise positioning.
